<div class="entry-content"><p>&nbsp;Sunday afternoon, I have nothing to do after a whole sitting in front of computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What was I doing at this moment when in high school? Definitely rushing to the basketball court soon after the school bus arriving. It would always be the most exciting time in a week, because basketball can&#8217;t be touched at the former day (Saturday at home). All fellows together(we three[XMS,CY,ME] first made a deal to get earlier for long playing time), came for the big party. LinYuJjie, WangZhe, WangJiaWei, SuYu, SongYanYang, ChenRen, WangShuang, QianCheng, DaRouGe, Friends from YuYin&#8230;&#8230; I did remember&nbsp;usually&nbsp;this time I do not have a good status, but happy.</p>
<p>So today after a little through, I decided to go to the basketball court. Wait a minute, before today&#8217;s game, I want to talk about yesterday night game. With Luo, we two go to court at about 21:30. It&#8217;s the first time play basketball since the National Day holiday, which has been more than a week. It is unbelievable when in high school. OK, we played with some fellows at the lightest street lamp. From the first sight, basically I know their level. Tell the truth, they are not better then me at my second year of middle high school. Just a short point guard seems to have some capacity of getting points. His speed is good, but attack ways is limited. He can only crossover to his left side and lay up. Besides, he sometimes can achieve a dgree hit rate of shooting. Except this two good points, no passing skill, no leadership, no feeling of opportunity choosing. I think it is the typical time I display all of this kind of skill in basketball, although the opposites is weak. First I did a good job in pointing, no matter in shooting, or laying up,&nbsp;or posting-up playing. They all trust me and initially pass the ball to me. Second, I did not always attack by myself, if there is a good opportunity, I would pass the ball at the first time. In fact I really made a lot of assists. So nearly everyone in my team has a lot of chances to score. Thirdly, fairly I did a not bad job in leading, I conducted in the game by telling them when to score, when to pass, and where with on defense. At the end of the game, which is the most exciting period, they failed stop me by using any methods to me. With a final three point, this game was over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was hardly able to clam down, in such comfortable feelings. LOL, I was so&nbsp;stimulated that I sleep later than 1:00 yesterday, which is the last night in this semester.&nbsp;</p>
