<p>It&#8217;s the NOKIA 1616, One of the most Fundamental phone in the recent products.</p>
<p>Why do I thoose this one? but not some Android phone, or Symbian phone? Serveral factors I take into account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first one, which is the most fatal one, is the time I will spent on it. If I choose some Andorid phone(actually, I do have some target like samsung 5700, HTC wildfire&#8230;), I will not only take a lot of time on setuping lots of apps and refresh it to the latest OS version, but also spend timet to use these apps, then SNS, Weibo, renren&#8230;. However, if I those NOKIA 1616, there will be no such functions avalible. No SNS, no UCWeb, maybe QQ is also gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the last term,&nbsp;Let me make a evaluation.Suppose I spend&nbsp;15min on Sina Weibo,&nbsp;15min&nbsp;on QQ, 15min&nbsp;on renren, 15min&nbsp;on RSS. Total time is 1 hour. Considering the preparing time for GRE, there remains 60 day left. Then there wil be 60 hours wasted on cellphone, equivallently 5 days, almost a week. This time cost is unaffordable, so I do not choose Android or Symbian 60.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second factor is the cost. Compared with&nbsp;￥191 the price of NOKIA 1616, the cheapest Symbain60 phone is NOKIA 6120c, whose price is ￥800, nearly 4 times. Similarly, the prcies of Android phones are almost higher than ￥1000.</p>
<p>The third fator is power. It is said the the 1616 can be online for 6 weeks at best without charging. This sayings may be&nbsp;aggrandized, but for one week is a shock to me, because my service SAMSUNG i450 can will be out of power in half of a day with normal using. The power issue is the one of the deadly shortage of the Smart phone like Andorid and Symbian, which must be charge everyday.</p>
<p>The last reason is Updating of the Smart phone. If I spend one or two thousand yuan buying an android phone, it is definite thing that this phone is out of date. Now in the market, the newly relesed products are almost very expensive, ususly higher than ￥3000. Even though I bought the latest products with my bloodly money, newer tech is surging, higher CPU is manufacted, larger RAM is maked in half of a year. Especially in China, a unmatured smart phone envirnments, smart phone can not entirly do what thay can do. So why not save the money just wait for the real revolutionary moment, and revolutionary product.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the lasest reading salon of Loading, Wu presented his reading experience on the book, <em>The Non-designer&#8217;s Design Book</em>
 by Robin Williams. In the public room of Institute, where we all were enthusiastic in this discussion, rather than in East Nine classroom. </p>
<p>In this salon, Wu introduced a lot of theories about designing, which I remember few of them except Contrast, Conhesive&#8230;</p>
<p>Actually I don&#8217;t like these kinds of theories, through I don&#8217;t mean I belittle the authorities of this book or these theories. I would rather believe is a kind of ARTISTIC things. All theories is just the thirsting for the form of arts, which are as meaningless as the appendix of a human body. The exact Achilles&#8217; Ankle is the feeling occured when we saw it, which is head to discribed by common persons like us.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, since we design for realistic purpose, that design a produce for people to use, and we do not comperhensively  provide spiritual enjoyment as well as the paintings hunged on the wall of museum or galleries. </p>
<p>In term of the kind of view, several principles have to be observed, before we do the artisitic part in design. With these fundamental principles, it can be used without any problem, said by my little programic selfhood. </p>
<p>There are principles , or concepts, or theory expressed by Robin Williams, the writer, anyway should be followed in design process:</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse:separate;color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:normal;orphans:2;text-indent:0;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0;font-size:medium;">

<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Three GRE Writing courses has passed, and there is two coures left. &#8212;Lin interrupted me just seconds ago, sending Yang Lida&#8217; photo with his girl, a white warm-look-like girl. It&#8217;s amazing that how she be with people like Yang, since there seem no evidents for matching can be find between Yang and the white girl in the picture. Whatever, wish them good lucks. &#8212; Back to this article, I want to say that I am in serious attitude about WRITING, anything about English writing like bloging, with my lack of&nbsp;aptitude in writing.</p>
<p>So I will try to use any wired, even ridiculous sentences to compose my articles. It is a little bit nervous. I have no choice but to get the writing down, because of the necessary for GRE, for acdemic papers, for MCM paper and for bloging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Virtually, I never tends to any enthusiasm on the Writing Course, given by Teacher Tong Lin. I percived that she is a greatly good mon on her daughter. Whereas she&#8217;s class is boring, and simultaniously gabbed, even gabbed than Li Da and Zhu zhi cong. She also radiates gossip on&nbsp;nugaes&nbsp;senseless like Zhu.&nbsp;Tiger balm writing methods have been hated by me for two decades.</p>
<p>Today the middle exam is over, gone with a little disappointments on Java exam. I was disrupted by lots of strange thought. So I hope article can be comprehensviely written about New Oriental, but not at this moment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night in the reading class, I read a short passage, which tells that great comics are never otherwordly and it never mystify us. They seek to accentuate the contradicitions in the social actions, not gloss over or transcend them by appeals to extrasocial symbols of divine ends, cosmic purpose, or laws of nature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The characters of great comics is no other than the character in which form I want to express my bloggings. Every time the signal of writing occur to me, the first thing I think is something big, holy or cosmical. But in fact I myself have master such skills or thoughts. Perhaps such stereotype forms in the 7 years&#8217; high school writing experience. Every composition force me to write something that I never thought in my mind. So that the result of why I always hate writing worse than anything else, then gradually formed the writingphobia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the first expression of New Oriental course, I found it&#8217;s like a warfare. Any minute when you are out of your mind may kick you off. Three reasons may explained. </p>
<p>First, the speed of the teacher is very high. Nearly our teacher speaking for the whole ninety minutes without a little rest. Also the thinking speed is especially high that I have take all my concentration on what he said. Even though, I t is still hard to entirely understand his speech.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, the atmosphere is high bloody pressured. I was sitting at the last third row. I can see the whole class. And I found it is the most&nbsp;conscientious class I have ever take. Everyone is listening seriously to the course. This kind of atmosphere let myself go serious too.</p>
<p>Third, It cost my parents 1580 RMB to take this class. I must to make it worth the price, with taking my efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another scene impressed me last night. At the middle rest of the class, when is dark outside, I want to take a look at the outside scenery. It is any kinds of little stalls, including barbecues, boiling foods, bootleg books, snacks, cloths. It is quite lively and chaotic. Actually I don&#8217;t really like them. But it is the very scene that I didn&#8217;t have seen for really a long time, maybe 10 years. I can feel that I am acquainted with it several years ago when also taking a night school of New Concept English in HuXin high school. It is in my first year in middle high school. When the class is over which is almost near nine, ChenZhao who learning together with me like to eat the same kind of snack like that in bazzar last night.</p>
<p>It is the same kind of feelings in the bazzar, but different after the bazzar.&nbsp;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&nbsp;Sunday afternoon, I have nothing to do after a whole sitting in front of computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What was I doing at this moment when in high school? Definitely rushing to the basketball court soon after the school bus arriving. It would always be the most exciting time in a week, because basketball can&#8217;t be touched at the former day (Saturday at home). All fellows together(we three[XMS,CY,ME] first made a deal to get earlier for long playing time), came for the big party. LinYuJjie, WangZhe, WangJiaWei, SuYu, SongYanYang, ChenRen, WangShuang, QianCheng, DaRouGe, Friends from YuYin&#8230;&#8230; I did remember&nbsp;usually&nbsp;this time I do not have a good status, but happy.</p>
<p>So today after a little through, I decided to go to the basketball court. Wait a minute, before today&#8217;s game, I want to talk about yesterday night game. With Luo, we two go to court at about 21:30. It&#8217;s the first time play basketball since the National Day holiday, which has been more than a week. It is unbelievable when in high school. OK, we played with some fellows at the lightest street lamp. From the first sight, basically I know their level. Tell the truth, they are not better then me at my second year of middle high school. Just a short point guard seems to have some capacity of getting points. His speed is good, but attack ways is limited. He can only crossover to his left side and lay up. Besides, he sometimes can achieve a dgree hit rate of shooting. Except this two good points, no passing skill, no leadership, no feeling of opportunity choosing. I think it is the typical time I display all of this kind of skill in basketball, although the opposites is weak. First I did a good job in pointing, no matter in shooting, or laying up,&nbsp;or posting-up playing. They all trust me and initially pass the ball to me. Second, I did not always attack by myself, if there is a good opportunity, I would pass the ball at the first time. In fact I really made a lot of assists. So nearly everyone in my team has a lot of chances to score. Thirdly, fairly I did a not bad job in leading, I conducted in the game by telling them when to score, when to pass, and where with on defense. At the end of the game, which is the most exciting period, they failed stop me by using any methods to me. With a final three point, this game was over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was hardly able to clam down, in such comfortable feelings. LOL, I was so&nbsp;stimulated that I sleep later than 1:00 yesterday, which is the last night in this semester.&nbsp;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I heart a saying from somewhere that appropriate rest make you works better. A lot of great ideas does not come from regular works but the rest time. So a &nbsp;successful person must learn the skill of resting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at my life, it&#8217;s really like that there is a military in my head. I made a lot of plan, fully for everyday, even in the long vacation in the National Day. Also I forced myself execute the plan solidly, aiming to burn out every cell in my body and mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then what&#8217;s stick around me everyday? Courses, GRE words, listening materials, academic papers, coffee&#8230;</p>
<p>What I really want to do? Go travelling around(but no proper place, no proper friend, no proper time), reading books quietly, full sleep, watch movies(seems no good movies now), make simple writing like this one&#8230;</p>
<p>So, cheerfully, I have decided every Sunday is the RESTING DAY. I can leaving any routines and do whatever I like. It is totally free in every cell of me. I don&#8217;t need to plan for anything.</p>
<p>Therefore, any other work that used to be done in Sunday should be move to the other day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Chaffy Dish or Huo Guo or Fire Boiler is a&nbsp;famous&nbsp;kind of dish. On the Chaffy Dish(maybe is the accurate name), We cool raw food in the boiling soup which always been separated into spicy and not spicy in the shape of <em>the Eight Diagrams</em>. When the raw food has been cooled, we can put it dip in sauces which usually teel oil with&nbsp;mashed garlic. Then we can taste it.</p>
<p>Yesterday with <em>AppleET</em> we went to a Chaffy Dish restaurant named <em>Chang Yi Kou Huo Guo</em>(I found this restaurant on dianping.com which is a website for evaluating restaurants or stores.&nbsp;). AppleET is a typical ChongQing girl who love the Chaffy Dish best, and she always confirm that ChongQing is the true birthland of&nbsp;Chaffy Dish, not SiChuan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is hard to describe how the dishes tasted, but in a word, it is vary delicious. AppleET even prise that it is the best Chaffy Dish in Wuhan she has ever taken. And more seriously we two spend 171 yuan totally for this dish, which is really high cost -_-. Any way, it is really great moment in the first thirty minutes of the dish. Especially for me, it has been more than a month to taste such such amazing food. What I taken is boring breakfast and boring dinner and nothing at night. More than sixty percent I have eaten is the same, which are nothing more than Hot Dry Noodles, Fried Egg Cake,&nbsp;soya-bean milk in breakfast and two Liang(a unit of weight) Rice, a kind of meat dish and a vegetable dish. At night comes a fruit dish, sometimes apple, sometimes pears, sometimes mixed. It is because I am going on a diet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Close the end of the dish, I found I eat to much and my stomach was aching. It is such an extremely pain period that I nearly want to throw up. If I eat at that moment, any food can be the&nbsp;blasting fuse of the throwing up. About thirty minutes past, I just feel better. But AppleET was enjoying as happily as before and laughing at me -_-.</p>
<p>After the dish, we rush back to school by taxi. Then I went to a big big sleep. Even now, I can still feel the fire in my stomach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all, in the third day of the long holiday, I nominally take a real relaxation for the further hard life.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Two days have gone of the seven days holiday. It is fast because I planed a lot for this seven days. But till now, nearly nothing has been start really with heart.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Generally speaking, it is result from the stereotype sense of holiday which should be time to relax conflicting with my ambition to study in this special time. Ha ha , Like the first blog, it can be called dilemma again. I want to study now, but in this moment I have not been doing any studying for almost twenty years.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Maybe I should go out to relax for a while, then come back. I will get some fresher air of study.</p>
