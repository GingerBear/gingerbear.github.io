  <div class="entry-content"><p>Three GRE Writing courses has passed, and there is two coures left. &#8212;Lin interrupted me just seconds ago, sending Yang Lida&#8217; photo with his girl, a white warm-look-like girl. It&#8217;s amazing that how she be with people like Yang, since there seem no evidents for matching can be find between Yang and the white girl in the picture. Whatever, wish them good lucks. &#8212; Back to this article, I want to say that I am in serious attitude about WRITING, anything about English writing like bloging, with my lack of&nbsp;aptitude in writing.</p>
<p>So I will try to use any wired, even ridiculous sentences to compose my articles. It is a little bit nervous. I have no choice but to get the writing down, because of the necessary for GRE, for acdemic papers, for MCM paper and for bloging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Virtually, I never tends to any enthusiasm on the Writing Course, given by Teacher Tong Lin. I percived that she is a greatly good mon on her daughter. Whereas she&#8217;s class is boring, and simultaniously gabbed, even gabbed than Li Da and Zhu zhi cong. She also radiates gossip on&nbsp;nugaes&nbsp;senseless like Zhu.&nbsp;Tiger balm writing methods have been hated by me for two decades.</p>
<p>Today the middle exam is over, gone with a little disappointments on Java exam. I was disrupted by lots of strange thought. So I hope article can be comprehensviely written about New Oriental, but not at this moment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night in the reading class, I read a short passage, which tells that great comics are never otherwordly and it never mystify us. They seek to accentuate the contradicitions in the social actions, not gloss over or transcend them by appeals to extrasocial symbols of divine ends, cosmic purpose, or laws of nature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The characters of great comics is no other than the character in which form I want to express my bloggings. Every time the signal of writing occur to me, the first thing I think is something big, holy or cosmical. But in fact I myself have master such skills or thoughts. Perhaps such stereotype forms in the 7 years&#8217; high school writing experience. Every composition force me to write something that I never thought in my mind. So that the result of why I always hate writing worse than anything else, then gradually formed the writingphobia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the first expression of New Oriental course, I found it&#8217;s like a warfare. Any minute when you are out of your mind may kick you off. Three reasons may explained. </p>
<p>First, the speed of the teacher is very high. Nearly our teacher speaking for the whole ninety minutes without a little rest. Also the thinking speed is especially high that I have take all my concentration on what he said. Even though, I t is still hard to entirely understand his speech.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, the atmosphere is high bloody pressured. I was sitting at the last third row. I can see the whole class. And I found it is the most&nbsp;conscientious class I have ever take. Everyone is listening seriously to the course. This kind of atmosphere let myself go serious too.</p>
<p>Third, It cost my parents 1580 RMB to take this class. I must to make it worth the price, with taking my efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another scene impressed me last night. At the middle rest of the class, when is dark outside, I want to take a look at the outside scenery. It is any kinds of little stalls, including barbecues, boiling foods, bootleg books, snacks, cloths. It is quite lively and chaotic. Actually I don&#8217;t really like them. But it is the very scene that I didn&#8217;t have seen for really a long time, maybe 10 years. I can feel that I am acquainted with it several years ago when also taking a night school of New Concept English in HuXin high school. It is in my first year in middle high school. When the class is over which is almost near nine, ChenZhao who learning together with me like to eat the same kind of snack like that in bazzar last night.</p>
<p>It is the same kind of feelings in the bazzar, but different after the bazzar.&nbsp;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&nbsp;Sunday afternoon, I have nothing to do after a whole sitting in front of computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What was I doing at this moment when in high school? Definitely rushing to the basketball court soon after the school bus arriving. It would always be the most exciting time in a week, because basketball can&#8217;t be touched at the former day (Saturday at home). All fellows together(we three[XMS,CY,ME] first made a deal to get earlier for long playing time), came for the big party. LinYuJjie, WangZhe, WangJiaWei, SuYu, SongYanYang, ChenRen, WangShuang, QianCheng, DaRouGe, Friends from YuYin&#8230;&#8230; I did remember&nbsp;usually&nbsp;this time I do not have a good status, but happy.</p>
<p>So today after a little through, I decided to go to the basketball court. Wait a minute, before today&#8217;s game, I want to talk about yesterday night game. With Luo, we two go to court at about 21:30. It&#8217;s the first time play basketball since the National Day holiday, which has been more than a week. It is unbelievable when in high school. OK, we played with some fellows at the lightest street lamp. From the first sight, basically I know their level. Tell the truth, they are not better then me at my second year of middle high school. Just a short point guard seems to have some capacity of getting points. His speed is good, but attack ways is limited. He can only crossover to his left side and lay up. Besides, he sometimes can achieve a dgree hit rate of shooting. Except this two good points, no passing skill, no leadership, no feeling of opportunity choosing. I think it is the typical time I display all of this kind of skill in basketball, although the opposites is weak. First I did a good job in pointing, no matter in shooting, or laying up,&nbsp;or posting-up playing. They all trust me and initially pass the ball to me. Second, I did not always attack by myself, if there is a good opportunity, I would pass the ball at the first time. In fact I really made a lot of assists. So nearly everyone in my team has a lot of chances to score. Thirdly, fairly I did a not bad job in leading, I conducted in the game by telling them when to score, when to pass, and where with on defense. At the end of the game, which is the most exciting period, they failed stop me by using any methods to me. With a final three point, this game was over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was hardly able to clam down, in such comfortable feelings. LOL, I was so&nbsp;stimulated that I sleep later than 1:00 yesterday, which is the last night in this semester.&nbsp;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I heart a saying from somewhere that appropriate rest make you works better. A lot of great ideas does not come from regular works but the rest time. So a &nbsp;successful person must learn the skill of resting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at my life, it&#8217;s really like that there is a military in my head. I made a lot of plan, fully for everyday, even in the long vacation in the National Day. Also I forced myself execute the plan solidly, aiming to burn out every cell in my body and mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then what&#8217;s stick around me everyday? Courses, GRE words, listening materials, academic papers, coffee&#8230;</p>
<p>What I really want to do? Go travelling around(but no proper place, no proper friend, no proper time), reading books quietly, full sleep, watch movies(seems no good movies now), make simple writing like this one&#8230;</p>
<p>So, cheerfully, I have decided every Sunday is the RESTING DAY. I can leaving any routines and do whatever I like. It is totally free in every cell of me. I don&#8217;t need to plan for anything.</p>
<p>Therefore, any other work that used to be done in Sunday should be move to the other day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Chaffy Dish or Huo Guo or Fire Boiler is a&nbsp;famous&nbsp;kind of dish. On the Chaffy Dish(maybe is the accurate name), We cool raw food in the boiling soup which always been separated into spicy and not spicy in the shape of <em>the Eight Diagrams</em>. When the raw food has been cooled, we can put it dip in sauces which usually teel oil with&nbsp;mashed garlic. Then we can taste it.</p>
<p>Yesterday with <em>AppleET</em> we went to a Chaffy Dish restaurant named <em>Chang Yi Kou Huo Guo</em>(I found this restaurant on dianping.com which is a website for evaluating restaurants or stores.&nbsp;). AppleET is a typical ChongQing girl who love the Chaffy Dish best, and she always confirm that ChongQing is the true birthland of&nbsp;Chaffy Dish, not SiChuan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is hard to describe how the dishes tasted, but in a word, it is vary delicious. AppleET even prise that it is the best Chaffy Dish in Wuhan she has ever taken. And more seriously we two spend 171 yuan totally for this dish, which is really high cost -_-. Any way, it is really great moment in the first thirty minutes of the dish. Especially for me, it has been more than a month to taste such such amazing food. What I taken is boring breakfast and boring dinner and nothing at night. More than sixty percent I have eaten is the same, which are nothing more than Hot Dry Noodles, Fried Egg Cake,&nbsp;soya-bean milk in breakfast and two Liang(a unit of weight) Rice, a kind of meat dish and a vegetable dish. At night comes a fruit dish, sometimes apple, sometimes pears, sometimes mixed. It is because I am going on a diet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Close the end of the dish, I found I eat to much and my stomach was aching. It is such an extremely pain period that I nearly want to throw up. If I eat at that moment, any food can be the&nbsp;blasting fuse of the throwing up. About thirty minutes past, I just feel better. But AppleET was enjoying as happily as before and laughing at me -_-.</p>
<p>After the dish, we rush back to school by taxi. Then I went to a big big sleep. Even now, I can still feel the fire in my stomach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all, in the third day of the long holiday, I nominally take a real relaxation for the further hard life.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Two days have gone of the seven days holiday. It is fast because I planed a lot for this seven days. But till now, nearly nothing has been start really with heart.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Generally speaking, it is result from the stereotype sense of holiday which should be time to relax conflicting with my ambition to study in this special time. Ha ha , Like the first blog, it can be called dilemma again. I want to study now, but in this moment I have not been doing any studying for almost twenty years.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Maybe I should go out to relax for a while, then come back. I will get some fresher air of study.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is not easy to get start type down any English words in this editor because there is an transition between typing and thinking especially when writing and blog words like what I am writing. From T and G words book, I remember a word called &#8220;dilemma&#8221; which means some situation that whatever you can do will lead to a bad result, and then you get the feeling of dilemma. I think I am in two dilemmas. The first one is that there are a lot of thing in my mind, but I am not able to express them in English. The second is that it has been a longing time from the last i wrote any mood logs. It is not said I didn&#8217;t write any articles. Actually Most of what I wrote are something like plans, thesis(little formal) or descriptions which there is template to use and follow on. So the freedom of writing is not familiar to me.(I hope there is no syntax error in this sentence&#8230;= =)</p>
<p>OK, craps is over. Let me get start.</p>
<p>First, there is some question?</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>1. Why do the blog?</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>2. Why blog in English?</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>3. What will be written in this blog?</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>&#8230;(maybe more)</p>
<p>I heart someone says rights and duties are one kind of single thing that can not be divided, like the Yin and Yang in Tai Ji. (seems no one said, anyway I for the next sentence) So there should be some limit of the writing freedom. I mean there should be a framework to whatever you do or write. Without any boundary, nobody include myself can not get the point. I think these questions are the frameworks.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Let me answer the questions.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span><span style="text-decoration:underline;">1. Why do the blog?</span></p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Actually this idea have&nbsp;stick around my mind for a long time. And I had tried once several months ago in wordpress.com. It is really slow to visit that site although it is great blog website (much better than some bus = =). Adding the natural difficulties writing blogs especially English blog for a no-English person, I quit soon with a single blog writing. However it&#8217;s different this time because of the GRE and my confident ambition to learn English well. With one month healthy start in this semester the victory has only a half way.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>The main purposes of bloging is of course for learning English. Writing will make me skillful with English. Also it provide a platform to practice what I have in other site (words, readings, listening materials, such). With the blog I can review my thinkings and the struggle history, I believe it will be a good memory in my life.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>My blog is public on the Internet, so I can share my experience and ideas with everyone including my friends. It&#8217;s good feeling to receive any comments from others.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span><span style="text-decoration:underline;">2. Why blog in English?</span></p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>I have another blog in TianYa in Chinese which is also a past time. At the first time, I wrote some through and mood log in the blog. With the time goes by it become my goals maker in the internet, because I want to cheer me up with some goals. Then I found Google Calendar does a much greater bog in goal-setting and gradually I forget my TianYa blog.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>In English, the benefits is said in the previous answers, setting a English environment &nbsp;for me.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span><span style="text-decoration:underline;">3. What will be written in this blog?</span></p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>It should be my thinking about my research in projects and the curriculum. Using the new words and sentences I learnt.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Besides, my mood log will be another part in this blog.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>It is not necessary to repost any other articles to my blog. Also, something like planing is also not pleased because of the Google Calendar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Originally , there should be five questions. But when I finishing answering the third question, I found the rest two question has been answered the three answers.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>OK, it seem not a worry about the lack of words for this true article.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>It is good start.</p>
