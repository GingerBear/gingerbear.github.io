  <div class="entry-content"><p>&nbsp;Sunday afternoon, I have nothing to do after a whole sitting in front of computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What was I doing at this moment when in high school? Definitely rushing to the basketball court soon after the school bus arriving. It would always be the most exciting time in a week, because basketball can&#8217;t be touched at the former day (Saturday at home). All fellows together(we three[XMS,CY,ME] first made a deal to get earlier for long playing time), came for the big party. LinYuJjie, WangZhe, WangJiaWei, SuYu, SongYanYang, ChenRen, WangShuang, QianCheng, DaRouGe, Friends from YuYin&#8230;&#8230; I did remember&nbsp;usually&nbsp;this time I do not have a good status, but happy.</p>
<p>So today after a little through, I decided to go to the basketball court. Wait a minute, before today&#8217;s game, I want to talk about yesterday night game. With Luo, we two go to court at about 21:30. It&#8217;s the first time play basketball since the National Day holiday, which has been more than a week. It is unbelievable when in high school. OK, we played with some fellows at the lightest street lamp. From the first sight, basically I know their level. Tell the truth, they are not better then me at my second year of middle high school. Just a short point guard seems to have some capacity of getting points. His speed is good, but attack ways is limited. He can only crossover to his left side and lay up. Besides, he sometimes can achieve a dgree hit rate of shooting. Except this two good points, no passing skill, no leadership, no feeling of opportunity choosing. I think it is the typical time I display all of this kind of skill in basketball, although the opposites is weak. First I did a good job in pointing, no matter in shooting, or laying up,&nbsp;or posting-up playing. They all trust me and initially pass the ball to me. Second, I did not always attack by myself, if there is a good opportunity, I would pass the ball at the first time. In fact I really made a lot of assists. So nearly everyone in my team has a lot of chances to score. Thirdly, fairly I did a not bad job in leading, I conducted in the game by telling them when to score, when to pass, and where with on defense. At the end of the game, which is the most exciting period, they failed stop me by using any methods to me. With a final three point, this game was over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was hardly able to clam down, in such comfortable feelings. LOL, I was so&nbsp;stimulated that I sleep later than 1:00 yesterday, which is the last night in this semester.&nbsp;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I heart a saying from somewhere that appropriate rest make you works better. A lot of great ideas does not come from regular works but the rest time. So a &nbsp;successful person must learn the skill of resting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at my life, it&#8217;s really like that there is a military in my head. I made a lot of plan, fully for everyday, even in the long vacation in the National Day. Also I forced myself execute the plan solidly, aiming to burn out every cell in my body and mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then what&#8217;s stick around me everyday? Courses, GRE words, listening materials, academic papers, coffee&#8230;</p>
<p>What I really want to do? Go travelling around(but no proper place, no proper friend, no proper time), reading books quietly, full sleep, watch movies(seems no good movies now), make simple writing like this one&#8230;</p>
<p>So, cheerfully, I have decided every Sunday is the RESTING DAY. I can leaving any routines and do whatever I like. It is totally free in every cell of me. I don&#8217;t need to plan for anything.</p>
<p>Therefore, any other work that used to be done in Sunday should be move to the other day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Chaffy Dish or Huo Guo or Fire Boiler is a&nbsp;famous&nbsp;kind of dish. On the Chaffy Dish(maybe is the accurate name), We cool raw food in the boiling soup which always been separated into spicy and not spicy in the shape of <em>the Eight Diagrams</em>. When the raw food has been cooled, we can put it dip in sauces which usually teel oil with&nbsp;mashed garlic. Then we can taste it.</p>
<p>Yesterday with <em>AppleET</em> we went to a Chaffy Dish restaurant named <em>Chang Yi Kou Huo Guo</em>(I found this restaurant on dianping.com which is a website for evaluating restaurants or stores.&nbsp;). AppleET is a typical ChongQing girl who love the Chaffy Dish best, and she always confirm that ChongQing is the true birthland of&nbsp;Chaffy Dish, not SiChuan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is hard to describe how the dishes tasted, but in a word, it is vary delicious. AppleET even prise that it is the best Chaffy Dish in Wuhan she has ever taken. And more seriously we two spend 171 yuan totally for this dish, which is really high cost -_-. Any way, it is really great moment in the first thirty minutes of the dish. Especially for me, it has been more than a month to taste such such amazing food. What I taken is boring breakfast and boring dinner and nothing at night. More than sixty percent I have eaten is the same, which are nothing more than Hot Dry Noodles, Fried Egg Cake,&nbsp;soya-bean milk in breakfast and two Liang(a unit of weight) Rice, a kind of meat dish and a vegetable dish. At night comes a fruit dish, sometimes apple, sometimes pears, sometimes mixed. It is because I am going on a diet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Close the end of the dish, I found I eat to much and my stomach was aching. It is such an extremely pain period that I nearly want to throw up. If I eat at that moment, any food can be the&nbsp;blasting fuse of the throwing up. About thirty minutes past, I just feel better. But AppleET was enjoying as happily as before and laughing at me -_-.</p>
<p>After the dish, we rush back to school by taxi. Then I went to a big big sleep. Even now, I can still feel the fire in my stomach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all, in the third day of the long holiday, I nominally take a real relaxation for the further hard life.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Two days have gone of the seven days holiday. It is fast because I planed a lot for this seven days. But till now, nearly nothing has been start really with heart.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Generally speaking, it is result from the stereotype sense of holiday which should be time to relax conflicting with my ambition to study in this special time. Ha ha , Like the first blog, it can be called dilemma again. I want to study now, but in this moment I have not been doing any studying for almost twenty years.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Maybe I should go out to relax for a while, then come back. I will get some fresher air of study.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is not easy to get start type down any English words in this editor because there is an transition between typing and thinking especially when writing and blog words like what I am writing. From T and G words book, I remember a word called &#8220;dilemma&#8221; which means some situation that whatever you can do will lead to a bad result, and then you get the feeling of dilemma. I think I am in two dilemmas. The first one is that there are a lot of thing in my mind, but I am not able to express them in English. The second is that it has been a longing time from the last i wrote any mood logs. It is not said I didn&#8217;t write any articles. Actually Most of what I wrote are something like plans, thesis(little formal) or descriptions which there is template to use and follow on. So the freedom of writing is not familiar to me.(I hope there is no syntax error in this sentence&#8230;= =)</p>
<p>OK, craps is over. Let me get start.</p>
<p>First, there is some question?</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>1. Why do the blog?</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>2. Why blog in English?</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>3. What will be written in this blog?</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>&#8230;(maybe more)</p>
<p>I heart someone says rights and duties are one kind of single thing that can not be divided, like the Yin and Yang in Tai Ji. (seems no one said, anyway I for the next sentence) So there should be some limit of the writing freedom. I mean there should be a framework to whatever you do or write. Without any boundary, nobody include myself can not get the point. I think these questions are the frameworks.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Let me answer the questions.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span><span style="text-decoration:underline;">1. Why do the blog?</span></p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Actually this idea have&nbsp;stick around my mind for a long time. And I had tried once several months ago in wordpress.com. It is really slow to visit that site although it is great blog website (much better than some bus = =). Adding the natural difficulties writing blogs especially English blog for a no-English person, I quit soon with a single blog writing. However it&#8217;s different this time because of the GRE and my confident ambition to learn English well. With one month healthy start in this semester the victory has only a half way.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>The main purposes of bloging is of course for learning English. Writing will make me skillful with English. Also it provide a platform to practice what I have in other site (words, readings, listening materials, such). With the blog I can review my thinkings and the struggle history, I believe it will be a good memory in my life.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>My blog is public on the Internet, so I can share my experience and ideas with everyone including my friends. It&#8217;s good feeling to receive any comments from others.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span><span style="text-decoration:underline;">2. Why blog in English?</span></p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>I have another blog in TianYa in Chinese which is also a past time. At the first time, I wrote some through and mood log in the blog. With the time goes by it become my goals maker in the internet, because I want to cheer me up with some goals. Then I found Google Calendar does a much greater bog in goal-setting and gradually I forget my TianYa blog.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>In English, the benefits is said in the previous answers, setting a English environment &nbsp;for me.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span><span style="text-decoration:underline;">3. What will be written in this blog?</span></p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>It should be my thinking about my research in projects and the curriculum. Using the new words and sentences I learnt.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Besides, my mood log will be another part in this blog.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>It is not necessary to repost any other articles to my blog. Also, something like planing is also not pleased because of the Google Calendar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Originally , there should be five questions. But when I finishing answering the third question, I found the rest two question has been answered the three answers.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>OK, it seem not a worry about the lack of words for this true article.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>It is good start.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">I used to have two and half months to prepare for my TOEFL,and it past the first month now.

I feel that I have make a good progress in this month,especially  my reading skill.

Also the tough job &#8211;words&#8211;had been finished,though it&#8217;s not stable.Reviewing the words might be one of things that should be done next month.

Next,it&#8217;s the listening that I do listened a lot English materials such as college lectures,BBC news,few novels,but it seemingly didn&#8217;t make too much effects.I didn&#8217;t feel I had made much progress in listening to English.So making some changes in ways of practice should be planed next.

In the writing field there is zero.though t says that it&#8217;s the easiest part of the test,I have to develop it in the next weeks for 4 tests in the DELTA book.

Speaking,maybe the most difficult one for me,also be filled with nothing.I have to find a good way to practice ,but not just speak to myself when walking alone with some F words.

<strong> OK.that is the overlooking to all four parts.Here are some things i should do next. </strong>

In the first two weeks, finish the DELTA books include the 4 simulative test and review the words.

In addition,8 papers in related to Internet views should be finished in this two weeks.

Also,the courses should be condensed,which maintains <em>Economic</em> and<em> The Dynamics of Mass Communication .</em>

In the later two weeks,I should try my best to finish the BARRON Book in order to make time to finish the OG and the official simulative test in the last two weeks.

In the first week ,the New Orient IBT courses(finding the way to practice the writing and listening and speaking skill) will be necessary in next week&#8217;s 4 tests.So next month I should turn on my most energetic mode to do<strong> Books courses + all IBT courses + all DELTA Practice + 4 Papers + half Words.</strong>

At least one Blog every week,so next week I should make a week summery too.
