  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been looking for jobs in about last 4 months since I graduated in Dec last year. Lots of things happened, both happy and unhappy thing among them. Now I am waiting for the result of my last oppotunity. If negative, I most likly go back to China. So today I wanna write something about my story in last 4 months.</p>

<p>Why today? because I was happened to be a fiting mood for writing. In last four months, I was very rushed and focusing in learning knowledges and preparing for interviews. After finished the interview with Tencent, now everything need to do is waiting. And it is very fortunate that I am in a very positive, or happy status, at most of time. Negative energy first came from the job at Pitt.</p>

<h2>job at Pitt</h2>

<p>On Dec 2013, weeks before graduating, comming back from the saddness of breaking up, I re-gain the idea of finding a job in the state and sent an email to a professor I collaborated in the second semester. He used to express the willingness to employ me as stuff or researcher at the end of that co-working by telling me to contact him when leaving Pittsburgh. Couple of minutes after my email was sent, he reply me with postive attitude, which made me very delighted. When people ask about doing after graduate, I once made everyone (include myself) believe that I will work as a stuff in Pitt. However, thing was geting worse by delaying again and again. First professor told he needed weeks to get back from Prague. After back, he needed weeks to clear up his remaining works. After that, he needed to weeks to wait for meeting schedule with those higher person in charge of employment. And then meet was re-schedule two times. I was totally disappointed at that time. I express my disappointement but still keep pushing. At last, it end up with the professor not replying my email. I feel like abandoned.</p>

<h2>Start late</h2>

<p>During the contact with the professor, I naively believe that I was sure to get the job, so essentially I did not try to find other jobs. After messing up for nearly one and half months, I started my real job hunting. I picked up my CV and sent to as many as I can. (lately found it just far from enough). At the begining I pinned most of targets to Silicon Valley. Among them are most big companies and few startups. At the same time, I also apply for some local tech company at Pittsburgh, including GE healthcare and some on Linkedin. BTW, I never get any real interview from Linkedin. Linkedin looks so ugly and low taste, but everyone finding jobs need to use it. So I cannot help but hate it very much. Ok, that&rsquo;s enough. With weeks of waiting, I continusely recieve rejection email and no response. Someday at library, etlds ask me if I wanna apply for Branding Brand, a local startup building mobile app and web, which also is my last oppotunity here in the state.</p>

<h2>Story of Branding Brand</h2>

<p>The story of BB is also kinda long. I apply for the job very early and did have been contacted by hr. I was appointed for a phone interview for a front-end development position. I was very excited at that moment, because it is the first interview after months waiting. I made a very hardcore preparation for a week by going through a every question on the front end interview question github <a href="https://github.com/darcyclarke/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions">repo</a>. And of course, the interview went very well. However, the hr told me that they are in a &ldquo;hiring freeze&rdquo;. I guess because they wanna sync with the pitt career fair. So I wait for another three week for that job fair. And bad thing happened, hr told me that the front end position was probeberly filled. I then ask for another position, web development, which turns out still hiring. So I was appointed for another phone interview a week later. (oh, why not just onsite&hellip;) Phone passed and a week later finally onsite interview. Onsite is good but the manager is not avalible. Another week passed, and another onsite scheduled&hellip; Finally onsite was finnally done and it was already April 3. Then it is now that I am waiting for the final offer.</p>

<h2>Little episode of Qualaris</h2>

<p>During the BB interview, I also took another company&rsquo;s interview. It is a very starting startup at Pittsburgh Forbe ave named Qualaris and only four people, two developer, one research guy and one bussiness guy. They are doing healthcare with web app. I meet this company on the offcial website onf Ember.js. There is a meetup link to Pittsburgh&rsquo;s meetup of Ember.js. I found one of the developer of the company. Then I check their website and they are looking for front-end developer. I applied for it and get a phone interview in weeks, which is beyond my expectation. I was doing not bad in the phone interview. Then weeks later a onsite interview with two developer. I consider myself a already qualifed web developer. So their question cannot beat me in most case. Plus I have prepared for the interview for several weeks. So the tech interview was also good. Finally I met their two non-tech guys a week later. Their question are more focused on behavior questions. This make me not as good as those questions, but I am not bad at express myself. After all I am apply for a tech position and I met some problems and had experiences during project development. So I never out of words. Everything went well but the problem comes from them. They prefer me to make a internship first at summer, then decide to give a full offer. Well that is a little hard for me to accept. The contact is still on hold. I guess we are both not in a hurry.</p>

<h2>Now what</h2>

<p>My last day of the OPT three-month window is April 23. I just had the interview with Tencent yesterday. It result kinda okey and they are waiting me to take next onsite in Shenzhen when I come back to China. So it is pretty simple. If I get the offer from BB, I stay. If not, go back to China and start a another new plan.</p>

<time datetime="2014-02-17T13:19:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 17<span>th</span>, 2014</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>CSS3 sounds like new tech, but it has been around for years with a increasing adoption on main browsers. I have been using CSS for years, but mostly using those main features, or triditional CSS2 features like position, styling, flaoting, etc, and a little bit decorating CSS3 features like border-radius, and box-shadow. CSS is not difficult, and when I think I have master the basic, I stop exploring those new features and believe that they are still on the way on browser compatbility.</p>

<p>Recently front end technique is envolving so fast that experimental CSS3 things now become practical. Also due to the face that I have preparing for the front end job interview, I am going to make a wandering on these new features of CSS3.</p>

<h3>Decoration</h3>

<h4>box-shadow, border-radius, opacity</h4>

<p>Most common used CSS3 features, and they are very well supported by modern browsers. <code>box-shadow</code> make shadow very easy in web pages. There are several paramaters to precisely control shadows, color, offset, blur, speard and inner/outter. It is often use in popup, dropdown. It is already been vendor-prefix freed on my just look on google plus sharing popup. <code>border-radius</code> is a interesting one. It used to be a lot of round coner hack out there. Like background image replacing, pixel mimicing. And I used to get excieted by there hacks. But now, they all gone by the missive adoption of <code>border-radius</code>. It sample to use. We can control four corner by four radius parameters. <code>opacity</code> is intiative that it control the trnasperency of a element with a percentage value, which is very useful in styling, and has no side effect.</p>

<h3>Flexbox and layout</h3>

<p>I heard <code>flexbox</code> very early, with the phrase that it is the most wanted feature in CSS3. From my recent learning, it is used for layout, which is one of the most discuessed topic in css layout. There used to be 3 main layout methods on the market. Table is the note ancient. It put elements into a big table, arrange them by tr, td. It is sample but it not flexible. If we want complex layout, the markup will be massed. Second is using float. It is massively adopted. Elements is arranged horizontally by fix the width and float them. The limitation is that Their width are fixed, or at least one of them is fixed. Besides, it need some tricky way to clear these float. Third is using absolut position to control layout. The advantage is that they are very easy to control. It is more like drawing, rather than arranging. The drawback is that the main flow is breaked. The normal element flow is breaked, which make the layout less extendable.</p>

<p>Here comes the flexbox, it natually arrange the element horizontally in the flex contianer, or vertically. In the flex box container, it is very configrable to layout elements, not matter by horizontal, vertical, alignment, centering, evenly seperated, growing differently, or by custom order. It is like a new box flowing model that completely independent on normal box flow. So the flow item will not be affected by <code>float</code>, <code>clean</code> and <code>vertical-align</code>.</p>

<p>Another things need to be mentioned about layout is Grid system. Grid system is not a native css feature, but a third-party position framework that arrange elements on the page, by specifing a pre-defined class. It is suggested a optimal solution for large scaled page layout. From my personal usage of Bootstrap grid system, I feel it less flexible, but more consistent cross multi-pages. Also by grid system it is easy to implement an integrated responsive solutions.</p>

<h3>Animation</h3>

<h4>transition, animation</h4>

<p>Animation is good feature to make some easy animation. It is fairly sample to use and, more importantly, rendered by GPU, which means more smooth animation. There are two type of animation, transition and animation. Transition is simpler. It is a property of one element that indication some change of property should be gradually made. For example, element&rsquo;s width is changed by hovering. The width will change gradually. Change can only be applied to a set of properties like height/width, opacity, color, padding, margin, border, left/top. Properties that could be changed gradually. These change may triggered by a lot of event, hover, click, media-query, and javascript add class. Some parameter can also be added, like duration, delay, ease/linear, infinite.</p>

<p>Animation is little different. In order to make a animation. We first need to define an keyframe, which is defined by a bunch of properties in a period property. from <code>from</code> to <code>to</code>, or from <code>0%</code> to <code>50%</code> to <code>100%</code>. With keyframe defined, it can be assign to element by animation property, with a bunch of parameters like delay, duration, ease/linear, alternate, infinite to indicate that animation.</p>

<p>Another property is necessary to mention here, which is transform. I used to confuse it with transition. May because they looks like or they are always used together. So transform is just about four things: translate, scale, rotate, skew, and something matrix or 3d stuff. It can change an element&rsquo;s position, scale it, rotate it, and skew it.</p>

<p>TranslateZ(0) could be use as a hack to improve page render performance. It force an element into a new layer, to avoid unnecessary re-paint.</p>

<h3>Media Query</h3>

<p>Media Query is use to deal with different style for differnt devices or different screen size. With a media query, we can define a specific style for screen or print with max/min with of screen, orientation of device, use logic operator like and/or. When critiria meet, browser will load styles in it. This feature make reponsive design happened.</p>

<h3>Pseudo things</h3>

<p>Pseudo things include Pseudo class and Pseudo elements. Pseudo classes refers to most used hover, active, checked, focus. Some newly adoped CSS3 seletor like nth-child(), first-child, root. Pseudo element is more used, which is :before and :after. They literally insert a same element before/after the target element. We could set style on them to add no-sematic content-based style, like quotes, icon. They can also be used to clearfix float, by a after pseudo-element. Pseedo element must have a content property. Its content can be fill dymanically with markup attributes by <code>attr()</code>. There are a lot of interesting pseudo element usage in <a href="http://css-tricks.com/pseudo-element-roundup/">this page</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>this post also appear on this <a href="http://gingerbear.github.io/about">about page</a></p></blockquote>

<p>I am new-graduated student from University of Pittsburgh with a master degree in Information Science. I love technical stuffs. I start playing with computer at a fairly young age at about 10, which is specially young in a ordinary teacher family in China. My first OS was windows 98 on TCL desktop with a Celeron CPU. My first internet connection is <a href="http://www.eastday.com/">eastday.com</a>. I still cannot forget that existment. Fellowing technical move on the internet now is my daily routine.</p>

<p>My specific area is front-end development. I love playing with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. My first expose to font end stuff is in middle school around 2003, where we were guided by teacher to add a small piece of JavaScript to a HTML page in Dreamweaver, that could make an bunch of fancy stars flying around the mouse. I was shocked by that an have nothing to figure out that magic code.</p>

<p>During my undergraduate 4 years, I formally start learn programming. It was completely a stuggling experience because nobody was guiding me. I mess around with C, asp, Java, C#, .Net and finally PHP. It is a little bit embaressing to say that I love PHP. But at that time I find PHP so easy to understand and so flexiable to do what I want. With PHP, I built a CMS with two of my best friends <a href="http://www.weibo.com/xluo0209">Sean Luo</a> and <a href="http://www.weibo.com/appleet">Ivy Liu</a>. Now I still consider it a great work.</p>

<p>From the begining I feel myself love visual things. I hate reading when I was at a fairly big. I love drawing and watching. I can tell what is beauty and what is not. I also like programming. Then font-end development naturally come to my things to do. I start focusing my tech area to front-end from last two years since my intern at Cisco China RD center. My role is web developing. My works was appreciated by my colleagues and manager for it nice looking, good usibility. At that time, I start to learn JavaScript in deep level by reading <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/">Nicholas C. Zakas</a>&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Professional-JavaScript-for-Web-Developers-3rd-Edition.productCd-1118222199.html">Professional JavaScript for Web Developers</a> and <a href="http://www.crockford.com/">Douglas Crockford</a>&rsquo;s <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a>.</p>

<p>Now I am armed with modern font-end workflow with Mac, Sublime Text, Chrome DevTools, Git, Github, Front-end MVC, Grunt, Yeoman, Modular Pattern, etc. JavaScript I moving really fast and is becoming a super language that can do anything. More importantly, JavaScript comes with a better community that everyone is more like to open, share, help. It indeed have a lot of problem with the language itself that lots of arguments happened everyday. But argument is a good thing. It make things better. And I feel lucky that I am not get lost in the fancy tech world. In the following career that I am facing, I am pretty sure that what I should do and what I can achieve.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since many friends and me are trying to hunting job in the US. I realize there should be a place for us to discuss and share. I am think if I could build some thing that may be used for that. We will benefit from that tool and I will benefit from building that tool. Even some friends may join us building this tool and make it open-source.</p>

<p>Generally, this tool should have serveral parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Coding Board</li>
<li>Discuess Board</li>
<li>Shared To-Do-List</li>
</ul>


<h2>Coding Board</h2>

<p>Most importantly, users are willing to have a place to post their coding puzzles, for asking help or for sharing good questions. The main page of coding board is a list of post, along with title, poster, participants, tags(help, good stuff), and time.</p>

<p>Clicking into a item in the list, it will go to the this puzzle page. It will show detail info of this puzzle. Next to the page, it will appended by a set of comment or answer to that puzzle. Also they could use @ sign to mention someone. (So far it is just like the github issue).</p>

<p>The editor for create new post should markdown and syntax highlights.</p>

<p>More features like assign helper to solve question and email notification.</p>

<h2>Discuess Board</h2>

<p>Users shared job info on this board. Like a good position opening. Or some interview experience sharing. Basicly, I this lit version of Coding Board. (Why not github)</p>

<h2>Shared To-Do-List</h2>

<p>I found myself can not live without a todo list. And I think it will be more powerful in incenting people to get shit done. Combining the coding board with the todo list, I kinda feel that will promote people to code more. Well, in a second thought, people may not that will to share their todo list. They are just not that enjoy making personal thing pulic to others. And they may feel guilty when they feel not finished the todo list, and don&rsquo;t want others know. So quite a few people may not share their todo list.</p>

<h2>In the End: Just use Github</h2>

<p>In the end of writing this post, I convinced myself not to build a customed tool specifically for this thing. It cost me too much, and just not gain too much, and people won&rsquo;t get too much better from this tool. Github is pretty well builted to fit most of the requirement. So why just make a repo, set a set of rules, and let them to join.</p>

<time datetime="2014-01-10T16:11:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 10<span>th</span>, 2014</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I used to void learning regular expression, because they looks too dry to digest. And in most case when I wanna use them, I can find existing ones on the web. But there are always a shadow in my mind that it is important. The shadow forms from when I found a lot of JavaScript books spending a whole chapter introducing Regular Expression. Weeks ago when I was reading Jeff Atwood&rsquo;s <em>Effective Programming: More Than Writing Code</em>, I read a chapter talking about phone screen. It point out five main part in phone screen.</p>

<ul>
<li>Coding</li>
<li>OO Programming</li>
<li>Scripting and Regular Expression</li>
<li>Data Structure</li>
<li>Bits and Bytes</li>
</ul>


<p>The <strong>Regular Expression</strong> hits me, and make me starting learn it. After reading the recommanded <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions?redirectlocale=en-US&amp;redirectslug=JavaScript%2FGuide%2FRegular_Expressions">MDN Article</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkluES9Rvak">video</a> presented by Lea Verou, I start to do the sample task on Jeff&rsquo;s book about Regular Expression.</p>

<h3>A phone number match</h3>

<p>Two kinds of phone should be matched: (123)-321-4321 and 123-321-4321.</p>

<p>First, the method I use is</p>

<pre><code>Regex.test(String)
</code></pre>

<p>it will return ture if match, false if not.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s do the first case. a &ldquo;(&rdquo; at the begining, so /(/. Then three number and a &ldquo;}&rdquo;, so /(\d{3})/. Then just &ldquo;&ndash;&rdquo; and three and four numbers, so</p>

<pre><code>/\(\d{3}\)-\d{3}-\d{4}/.
</code></pre>

<p>In the second case, there is not &ldquo;(&rdquo;. So &ldquo;(&rdquo; should occure once or not, so add a &ldquo;?&rdquo;.</p>

<pre><code>/\(?\d{3}\)?-\d{3}-\d{4}/.
</code></pre>

<p>However there is a false positive for something like 123)-321-4321. The solution is make it occur for both &ldquo;(&rdquo; and &ldquo;)&rdquo;, OR neither of them. so</p>

<pre><code>/((\d{3})|(\(\d{3}\)))-\d{3}-\d{4}/
</code></pre>

<p>Everyone told me how powerful Regular Expressiuon is, so I guess there are much more for me to discover.</p>

It can be runned by user on command line along with parameters. client will first lookup the naming server to find the address of mini-google, then request for a socket connection and then send index/query request to it with connection and then waiting for response.</p>

<h3>Mini-google</h3>

<p>First it will create a socket and binding with the address and port number, then listen() in a infinite loop. When receiving a request from client, it create a new process regarding to request type (index/query) to handle the request. After that, server will keeping listening for other requests.</p>

<h3>Worker</h3>

<p>Worker is the critical part of the whole work. It holds the connection with client and send result back to client if all mappers and reducers have done their work. It will split the file by the number of available mapper it got from name server. After file splitted, it will send each split to each mapper by a set of parameters</p>

<ul>
<li>split file name</li>
<li>document name</li>
<li>number of mappers // to let reducer know when to start reducing</li>
<li>address and ports of all reducers</li>
</ul>


<p>and then waiting for their response by holding connection on multi-threads. If all mappers response work done, it will send message to client and close the connection.</p>

<h3>Mapper helper</h3>

<p>Before working, it will register on name server when start running, with it address, port and type, which is &ldquo;mapper&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Mapper first do the word counting and combining on it splits by shell script using tr, sed, awk, uniq, sort. and then do partition on the map result, by the number of reducers. It do partition not by lines, but by alphabetic. Meaning if number of reducers is 2, result will be partition to two files, one with terms from [a-m], one with terms from [n-z], which refers to the step of shuffle. Then sent each partition to each reducer and waiting for their response by holding connection on multi-threads. If all reducers response work done, it will send message to worker and close the connection.</p>

<h3>Reducer helper</h3>

<p>Before working, it will register on name server when start running, with it address, port and type, which is &ldquo;reducer&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Reducer first get the number of mappers. By this number, it will know how many mapper it have to wait. After it received all data from mapper, it will start to aggregate the mapper by shell script with awk. Then it will start 5 thread to merge result to master index. When all thread done their job. Reducer will send message back to mapper that its work done.</p>

<h3>Name Server</h3>

<p>Naming server establish sockets and keep waiting for connection. It support two type of request,register and request. Register will store address, port, server type. Lookup will will send back a set of address, port and server type by server type and number. For example, get 5 mappers, or get 3 reducers.</p>

<h3>Master index</h3>

<p>In this project, name index is separated alphabetically in 26 files for each letter. The advantage is that they could be better paralleled in indexing and querying with less concern on blocking issues.</p>

<h2>莫扎特的Clarinet Concerto In A, K.622: 2. Adagio</h2>

<p>我正在反复听莫扎特的(Clarinet Concerto In A, K.622: 2. Adagio)[<a href="http://www.xiami.com/song/1770385763?spm=a1z1s.6659513.0.0.0555RH">http://www.xiami.com/song/1770385763?spm=a1z1s.6659513.0.0.0555RH</a>]，这首曲子能让人沉静下来能想想自己的事情。第一次听是在一个莫扎特的纪录片的片头曲听到，当时一听到那个单簧管吹出的旋律就很感动。</p>

<h2>毕业中</h2>

<h3>甘同学的包</h3>

<p>说说昨晚的一个事儿。昨天晚上与甘同学小聚，因为他要就要去加州了，月黑风高的去了匹兹堡市中心逛了逛聊了聊，回来的时候已经很晚了（或者说很早了，因为是早上六点），迷迷糊糊到了家马上就睡了，刚睡一会收到个电话说他包找不到了，里面有个两千多刀的单反，问我看看记不记得放哪儿了，我起来看了看包，发现是我自己包（恰好跟他的包除了颜色都是一样的），然后去门外看了看下车的地方也没有。我告诉他可能是放到原来的车里地上了，但他手机又没电了，钥匙在那包里也回不去。那个焦急的情景，我很能体会。中间他没有办法去买了个充电器去咖啡店充了电，又租了车去了躺路过的地方找，找不到，又打了911，甚至直接下单买了一台新的单反。到了早上我又收到了电话问我再确定一下路上有没有，尽管我很确定但还是去看了看，依旧什么都没有。我回到了房间坐再床上睡了，突然看到了我椅子下还有个包，就是他的包…… 看来是我昨晚下车的时候顺手把他的包当成我的包就直接拿走了，但是我完全不记得了。这事儿我感到十分抱歉，自己的一个犯傻导致他人身心具疲。</p>

<h3>学院三楼</h3>

<p>学院三楼一直是个热闹的地方，长期有邦邦同学把守，每次去那儿都挺欢乐。我平时不怎么去，直到这个学期的后半段去的比较多，一是由于图书馆人太多，位子不好找，二是跟认识的同学还能聊聊天，又是还能讨论讨论项目，运气好甚至还有免费的食物。在这段时间里也熟悉了不少新朋友，每次学习到后面就成了茶话会，大家还都听能聊的，还挺开心的。学院三楼的那个桌儿仿佛成了一个我们专业小伙伴们的据点，每天都会有小伙伴来首先将其霸占。</p>

<h3>Trees Hall</h3>

<p>打篮球的地儿，虽然比起国内的强多了，但地板还是不可避免的滑，我也不可避免的打得没有外场好。每周我都会来这里打两次球，认识了一堆小伙伴，真的有些不舍得离开。如果能找到匹兹堡大学的工作，最大的好处就是能继续在这儿打篮球。刚来的那会儿真是谁都不认识，很傻很天真的跟跟几个老黑打起半场来。后来打起全场第一次就更清华哥吵起来了（后来还是关系不错），狗腿后来把我拉近了他们的篮球队，每周二周五晚上都非常认真的在这里练联防和战术，当时的那几个在一队真的挺厉害的，甚至在trees都很难找到能打赢我们的队。首先我们的防守特别好，我们守的是联防，外线的补位非常及时，内线有狗腿的强硬防守。对手在进攻的时候除了投三分，几乎很难突破进来。在进攻端，大神的组织非常合理，他知道该怎么打，并且总能打出一些战术。我们还有生哥的三分球，以及非常好的快攻意识，我更像是个小前锋，进攻方式多是中投和三分，偶尔有一些挡拆的配合。后来对篮球最执着的狗腿回国了，大家似乎就没有当时的那种练球的劲头了，大家都有各自忙的事情，晚上来打球更多是为了消遣。我之前一直是做他们车过来，后面也逐渐的自己走过来了，渐渐跟他们也走得不是那么近了，更多的是想自己多发挥一些个人能力，因为说实话在之前强大打团队里，打球的方式非常单一，个人能力都退化了。总之这是一个值得回忆的地方，如果我留下，我想我需要去练练身体，把个人能力提上去。</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I bought the new macbook pro right after the latest release of MBP on Apple&rsquo;s event. I was so existed about the new macbook pro, and I becoming more and more display my PC. There are a lot to talk about my loving on the new macbook pro, and lot of dis-lovness of my samsung PC. It&rsquo;s too late and I want to post this blog before sleep. So let me be short for the most important benefit.</p>

<p>Oh, by the way, Apple just release the Bug fix for this macbook I using, which happens to be freeze on daily usage on a large set of new users. It is quite annoying for my mac freezing in the way I am using. What&rsquo;s worse is that I make me feel unsafe to use this machine, and always feeling it&rsquo;s gonna stuck. But finally, it is fixed. No freezing after tonight&rsquo;s update.</p>

<h2>No.1 Shortcuts</h2>

<p>What really make my working with mac effective is its massive and make-sense shortcuts. With command key combined with another key, I can operate faster than using mouse and trackpad. The most I use is</p>

<ul>
<li>cmd + q for close window or tab</li>
<li>cmd + q for quick application</li>
<li>cmd + l to select the address bar in browser</li>
<li>cmd + t to open a new tab</li>
<li>cmd + left/right arrow to the begin/end of line</li>
<li>option + left/right move cursor word by word</li>
<li>cmd + shift + 4 to screenshot</li>
</ul>


<p>I believe there are even more shortcuts to boost my usage.</p>

<p>In addition, Alfred, of course, let me open application, file and directory without open folder and folder in finder. Which speed up my productivity a lot.</p>

<h2>No.2 Trackpad</h2>

<p>I have not using mouse for two weeks. The trackpad is super responsive and really magic with those gestures. The most useful one is multi-screen by four finger swipe left/right. It make good to organizing my applications when I open a lot. And four finger swipe up, to organize my my application automatically. I feel very comfortable and easier with different functional separated screens.</p>

<h2>No.3 Screen</h2>

<p>When I see an non-retina screen now, I will feel a lot blur. This screen is very precise and with great color. The display resolution is actually 1280x800, making 4 pixels to render 1 pixel. I cannot see the pixel in the screen, or I can see pixel clearly those application without retina-display optimization. I feel very comfortable coding with this screen.</p>

<h2>No.4 keyboard</h2>

<p>A lot of laptops try to make their keyboard looks like macbook&rsquo;s. But they failed to make their keyboards type like macbook&rsquo;s. This keyboard&rsquo;s type feel is neat. Each key is well separate and with a little curve in from the middle of key, which make you feel explicitly typing right on the key. And the keys&#8217; positions are well set. Make my muscle feel nature and comfortable when I am typing. My last PC&rsquo;s keys are really bad-positioned.</p>

<h2>No.5 Light</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have to carry a so-heavy PC and charger to library everyday.</p>

<h2>No.6 Misc</h2>

<p>I call them miscellaneous not because they are not important, but they are not the greatest impact for me now. First is the batter life. I can working on it for a whole after without a charge. Second, good looking, yes, it looks beautiful like a art work. Then the charger, very well design. Cable can be well rolled on the charger. The port is magnetic and works for both direction.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The main things in mac is fast, clean and beautiful. I believe I won&rsquo;t change it in the following three years. Like the Julio, PhD Student of Peter, said, when I get the macbook (a old white plastic one), my life changed. I can feel that it is already change my life.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In last three days, I was trying to the operating system course project. It is a user level light-weight thread scheduler, with semaphores dealing with concurrency problem. Frankly I never did and multi-thread programming before, not to mention a write a multi-thread scheduler in C. And of course, I didn&rsquo;t do well with the operating system course. I will talk about the course at the end of this post. I almost forgot this homework until I found it just left three for the due. So what I do is not from nothing, but from my <a href="https://github.com/cadmuxe">cadmuxe</a>&rsquo;s code. Here I am gonna explain how it works.</p>

<h2>Description and Requirement</h2>

<p>The whole requirement is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oWoWm2MAQf7uEw0U8gwXLUK0ufQHAlexupOlO0o6QZTG3Z67kM7GrRFsV0a7LK1mHObatCizd_Y4_8RD/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. In short, the scheduler have</p>

<pre><code>lwt_init(int quantum)
</code></pre>

<p>to set up the main thread, the global thread, the signal hander and thread running intervel with the a period of time as parameter (quantum).</p>

<pre><code>lwt_create(char *name, void *argv, fun_type fn)
</code></pre>

<p>to create a thread with name, argument pointer and function pointer. and run it immediatly. return thread indentifier.</p>

<pre><code>lwt_sleep(int seconds)
</code></pre>

<p>to put current thread into sleep for seconds.</p>

<pre><code>thrd_wait(lwt *t)
</code></pre>

<p>to put current thread into wait until the input thread (child thread) exit.</p>

<pre><code>smphr_create(int size)
</code></pre>

<p>to create a semaphore with a input size, and init a thread queue for waiting list.</p>

<pre><code>P(smphr *s)
</code></pre>

<p>to acquire semaphore if avaible, if not, put current thread into queue</p>

<pre><code>V(smphr *s)
</code></pre>

<p>to release semaphore, and dequeue the front thread in queue</p>

<h2>How to achieve multi-thread</h2>

<p>The idea is pretty similar with multi-processes running on a single processor. Threads are switched in a fast speed with a process, making it like they are served simultaneously. But how to make the switch? Use <em>alarm signal</em> to interrupt running thread, <em>setjmp</em> to save its running environment and <em>longjmp</em> to restore to its that environment. Here is the code :</p>

<pre><code>lwt_init() 
{
    /* ... */

    signal(SIGALRM, alarm_handler);
    ualarm(lwt_quantum, 0);

    /* ... */
}

void alarm_handler () 
{
    /* ... */

    if (setjmp(sys_t.curr-&gt;env) == 0) { // interrupted, save current thread's runing environment. if get here from longjmp(), setjmp will return no-zero
        do {
            sys_t.curr = sys_t.curr-&gt;next; // set next thread as current thread

            /* ... check state of current thread here */

        } while (sys_t.curr-&gt;state != lwt_READY);

        ualarm(sys_t.interval + sys_t.curr-&gt;prior, 0);
        longjmp(sys_t.curr-&gt;env, 1);    // after switch, continue running environment where it was saved
    }

    /* ... */
}
</code></pre>

<p>There is a serious problem here. Thread are created on main thread (actually process), so when they run, a stack will be allocated on the top of main stack. The stack will be remove if the thread run is over (returned). There is no problem if thread run one by one. But in this case, they are running simultaneously (not precisely simultaneous, but running without end of others). The result is that all these threads are using a same stack. We know that when we perform of a setjmp, env save the stack pointer of the thread. So it comes to the situation that switching will make thread go back to its stack pointer, but the content of that stack will not its content. Stack is all messed.</p>

<p>A way to solve this is to give each thread its own stack when they created. This is achieve by a statement of assembly language. Code is there:</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef _X86
__asm__("mov %0, %%esp;": :"r"(sys_t.curr-&gt;stack + lwt_STACK_SIZE) );
#else
__asm__("mov %0, %%rsp;": :"r"(sys_t.curr-&gt;stack + lwt_STACK_SIZE) );
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know jack about assembly language. But I was told that it move the stack pointer to a new stack.</p>

<h2>How to implement Semaphore</h2>

<p>Semaphore actually is quite sample (the reason I say this, because I thought it was hard). It is like a gate keeper having a list of available rooms. It will tell the visitor if any room available. If yes, gate keeper will allow the visitor to use the room and reduce the number of available rooms. If no, put the visiter on the waiting list.</p>

<p>If the visitor has done with the room, gate keeper will make that room available again, and give it to the first visitor on the waiting list, and sure remove him from waiting list.</p>

<p>P() is for thread to achieve the first part (check and gain semaphore), V() is for the second part (release semaphore and give to to front waiting list). Here is the code:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct smphr_t {
    int     smphr_size;
    Queue   queue;              // queue store thread waiting for semophore
} smphr;

smphr * smphr_create(int smphr_size){
    smphr *s;
    s = malloc(sizeof(smphr));
    s-&gt;smphr_size = smphr_size;
    s-&gt;queue = CreateQueue();                   // use a queue to store waiting list
    return s;
}

void P(smphr *s){
    int left = ualarm(0, 0);                    // disable the context switch, by clear the alarm
    if(s-&gt;smphr_size &gt; 0){                      
        s-&gt;smphr_size -= 1;                     // semaphore offered
        ualarm(left, 0);                        // restore context switch
    } else {                                    // no more semaphore, blocked
        s-&gt;smphr_size -= 1;                     // TRICK! semaphore still need to be reduced one, in order to avoid fullCount getting too large. 
        sys_t.curr-&gt;state = sem_WAIT;
        Enqueue(sys_t.curr, s-&gt;queue);          // put into queue
        raise(SIGALRM);
    }
}

void V(smphr *s){
    int left = ualarm(0, 0);
    s-&gt;smphr_size += 1;                         // release semaphore
    if (!IsEmpty(s-&gt;queue)) {                   
        Front(s-&gt;queue)-&gt;state = lwt_READY;     // dequeue front and set to READY, if not empty
        Dequeue(s-&gt;queue);
    }
    ualarm(left, 0);
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Test with Producer-Consumer Problem</h2>

<p>The LWT can be tested by a classical Producer-Consumer problem. Producer produce item, Consumer consume item produced. If item buffer is full, producer should wait (producer trying to produce should be put on the waiting list) until item is consumed and buffer is not full. Consumer, similarly, should wait if item buffer is empty (put on waiting list), until item is produced and buffer is not empty.</p>

<p>So we need a fullCount Semaphore (max size of buffer) to decide if full, a emptyCount Semaphore (max size of buffer) to decide if empty and a useLock to only let one producer/consumer access to buffer at one time. Here is the code:</p>

<pre><code>void producer(){
    srand(time(NULL));  // Initializes random number generator
    int item = 0;
    while(1){        
        item = rand();
        P(emptyCount);
        P(useQueue);
        if (current &lt; N) {
            buffer[current++] = item;
        }
        V(useQueue);
        V(fullCount);
        printf("Producer: %s\tproduce: %d\te: %d\tf: %d\tSize:%d\n"
            , get_curr_name()
            , item
            , smphr_get_size(emptyCount)
            , smphr_get_size(fullCount)
            , current);
    }
}

void consumer(){
    int item = 0;
    int i = 0;
    while(i &lt; 30){ 
        P(fullCount);
        P(useQueue);
        if (current &gt; 0) {
            item = buffer[--current];
        }
        V(useQueue);
        V(emptyCount);
        printf("Consumer: %s\tconsume: %d\te: %d\tf: %d\tSize:%d\n"
            , get_curr_name()
            , item
            , smphr_get_size(emptyCount)
            , smphr_get_size(fullCount)
            , current);
        i++;
    }
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
    int i,j;
    lwt *t;
    emptyCount  = smphr_create(N);
    fullCount   = smphr_create(0);
    useQueue    = smphr_create(1);

    lwt_init(QUANTUM);

    lwt_create("p1", 0, NULL, producer);  
    lwt_create("p2", 0, NULL, producer);  
    lwt_create("p3", 0, NULL, producer);  
    lwt_create("p4", 0, NULL, producer);  
    lwt_create("c1", 0, NULL, consumer);     
    t = lwt_create("c2", 0, NULL, consumer);     

    thrd_wait(t);
    printf("Two Consumers consume 30 items!\n");
    printf("Done!\n");
}

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It has been a few weeks that I am thinking about writing a blog on the IS Reader project. In this post, I will try to answer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why did I start the project?</li>
<li>What will the product be functioning like?</li>
<li>How did I or will I deal with it?</li>
<li>What are the design rules that I am following?</li>
</ul>


<h2>Why did I start the project?</h2>

<p>There are a lot of reasons that finally lead me to build this reader. First and most importantly, When I reading some long documents, like a book, I found myself need a sample tool that can store a pdf document online, and everytime you open it on different devices, it will restore the previous page you read. I went throught a series of search but didn&rsquo;t find a sample solution. Kindle App may work but not allow pdf uploads. Dropbox and Google Drive show pdf cross device but cannot restore the progress, no need to say annoating or sharing. Foxit reader can restore but only work locally.</p>

<p>The secend reason is that, I was happened to take an independent study with Peter&rsquo;s, our program head, phd student Julio, who took me to the ReadingCycle project. It is also a reader project, but only work for picture format books. So it is a good change to do it along with the IS Reader. (Actually IS Reader the name came with the inital of School of <em>Information Science</em>, but not limit to that.)</p>

<p>Thirdly, I am on my way finding a job, this project will be a great enhancement of my experience and CV. I will try a lot of new technologies that could be written on my CV.</p>

<p>Finally, there is no such a product on the web and it is not that hard to build, so why don&rsquo;t I create one. Maybe it will grow into a real deal.</p>

<h2>What will the product be functioning and look like?</h2>

<p>On the first thought, the product is pretty sample. I can upload pdf documents on it, read it, restore the page on other devices and continue reading. By further thinking, it should support multi-user, not just me alone. Then it should provide a certain management page that can CRUD those documents. Next, it should allow user to annotate on the document. Finally, social stuff. User can share documents, notes with each other. They can track their progross. Product can even provide some kind of stratagy that my drive user to reader more, like comparing, gamification.</p>

<p>At this moment of my typing, I am thinking the goal of the product should be to <strong>make people more like to read</strong>, or to learn, since I read for learn.</p>

<h2>How did I or will I deal with it?</h2>

<p>As I mentioned, the article should be typed several weeks ago, which means I have started working on it for several weeks (19 days since its github inital commit). I choosed all those new technology from the begining. At the begining scaffolding stage, I user Yeomen to genate a express project and a webapp (merged in the middle of developing, cover later).</p>

<p>I use pdf.js for the JavaScript-based pdf rendering. Although its rendering is a bit not that sharp on windows, it is good enough for long time reading. Not surprisingly, it renders perfectly on MacBook Pro with Retina display (need to fix the scale issue), the one I just bought, and better on mac with no-Retina than windows.</p>

<p>For the server, I use Express on Node.js, Mongoose and MongoDB for the database, Jade for the template engine. In fact, I tried to build a pure RESTful for the server, so I didn&rsquo;t use Jade at the first time. But met a lot of issues. First I came across some cross-domain issue on the cross ajax call from the client. I tried jsonp and cors to fix it. Then I didn&rsquo;t find a way to validate user session in a rapid way except cookies (I don&rsquo;t have experience with OAuth). So I gave up the RESTful option, in order for the quick shipping.</p>

<p>For the client side, most code I wrote is about the reader page. The logic is sample and old-fashion, just some event binding and ajax call, store data in the dom. What&rsquo;s new is that I try to use some new JavaScript techniques. I use event delegation of those massive event bindings. I wrap the whole reader JavaScript logic in a constructor, which construct the JavaScript by parameters, hide internal private parameters and methods, and get inited by init(); Some progress was made, but way not enough. The code is close to spaghetti, dom bindings are hard coded inside. I am extremely want to make it modular and less coupled, maybe after a big release.</p>

<p>Now, basic funcitons till making note are made. Next thing should be involved with some social, with OAuth bulid in, and books management with one-page app style (AngularJS or BackboneJS).</p>

<h2>What are the design rules that I am following?</h2>

<p>It is too late now, let me be short. For the design, 3 rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rule 1: As easy to use as possible</li>
<li>Rule 2: As less reading interuption as possible</li>
<li>Rule 3: As clean and sample as possible</li>
</ul>


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Use the most quoted facebook works:</p>

<blockquote><p>Keep Focus and Keep Shipping</p></blockquote>

<p>That is all I need to do, no need to think to far. No matter what will the product be in the future, it has a good start, namely I build it for myself use.</p>
