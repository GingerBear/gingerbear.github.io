<p>Three GRE Writing courses has passed, and there is two coures left. ---Lin interrupted me just seconds ago, sending Yang Lida' photo with his girl, a white warm-look-like girl. It's amazing that how she be with people like Yang, since there seem no evidents for matching can be find between Yang and the white girl in the picture. Whatever, wish them good lucks. --- Back to this article, I want to say that I am in serious attitude about WRITING, anything about English writing like bloging, with my lack of&nbsp;aptitude in writing.</p>
<p>So I will try to use any wired, even ridiculous sentences to compose my articles. It is a little bit nervous. I have no choice but to get the writing down, because of the necessary for GRE, for acdemic papers, for MCM paper and for bloging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Virtually, I never tends to any enthusiasm on the Writing Course, given by Teacher Tong Lin. I percived that she is a greatly good mon on her daughter. Whereas she's class is boring, and simultaniously gabbed, even gabbed than Li Da and Zhu zhi cong. She also radiates gossip on&nbsp;nugaes&nbsp;senseless like Zhu.&nbsp;Tiger balm writing methods have been hated by me for two decades.</p>
<p>Today the middle exam is over, gone with a little disappointments on Java exam. I was disrupted by lots of strange thought. So I hope article can be comprehensviely written about New Oriental, but not at this moment.</p>
