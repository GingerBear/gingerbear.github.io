<p>I heart a saying from somewhere that appropriate rest make you works better. A lot of great ideas does not come from regular works but the rest time. So a &nbsp;successful person must learn the skill of resting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at my life, it's really like that there is a military in my head. I made a lot of plan, fully for everyday, even in the long vacation in the National Day. Also I forced myself execute the plan solidly, aiming to burn out every cell in my body and mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then what's stick around me everyday? Courses, GRE words, listening materials, academic papers, coffee...</p>
<p>What I really want to do? Go travelling around(but no proper place, no proper friend, no proper time), reading books quietly, full sleep, watch movies(seems no good movies now), make simple writing like this one...</p>
<p>So, cheerfully, I have decided every Sunday is the RESTING DAY. I can leaving any routines and do whatever I like. It is totally free in every cell of me. I don't need to plan for anything.</p>
<p>Therefore, any other work that used to be done in Sunday should be move to the other day.</p>
