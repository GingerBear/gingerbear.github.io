<p>It is not easy to get start type down any English words in this editor because there is an transition between typing and thinking especially when writing and blog words like what I am writing. From T and G words book, I remember a word called "dilemma" which means some situation that whatever you can do will lead to a bad result, and then you get the feeling of dilemma. I think I am in two dilemmas. The first one is that there are a lot of thing in my mind, but I am not able to express them in English. The second is that it has been a longing time from the last i wrote any mood logs. It is not said I didn't write any articles. Actually Most of what I wrote are something like plans, thesis(little formal) or descriptions which there is template to use and follow on. So the freedom of writing is not familiar to me.(I hope there is no syntax error in this sentence...= =)</p>
<p>OK, craps is over. Let me get start.</p>
<p>First, there is some question?</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>1. Why do the blog?</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>2. Why blog in English?</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>3. What will be written in this blog?</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>...(maybe more)</p>
<p>I heart someone says rights and duties are one kind of single thing that can not be divided, like the Yin and Yang in Tai Ji. (seems no one said, anyway I for the next sentence) So there should be some limit of the writing freedom. I mean there should be a framework to whatever you do or write. Without any boundary, nobody include myself can not get the point. I think these questions are the frameworks.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Let me answer the questions.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span><span style="text-decoration:underline;">1. Why do the blog?</span></p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Actually this idea have&nbsp;stick around my mind for a long time. And I had tried once several months ago in wordpress.com. It is really slow to visit that site although it is great blog website (much better than some bus = =). Adding the natural difficulties writing blogs especially English blog for a no-English person, I quit soon with a single blog writing. However it's different this time because of the GRE and my confident ambition to learn English well. With one month healthy start in this semester the victory has only a half way.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>The main purposes of bloging is of course for learning English. Writing will make me skillful with English. Also it provide a platform to practice what I have in other site (words, readings, listening materials, such). With the blog I can review my thinkings and the struggle history, I believe it will be a good memory in my life.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>My blog is public on the Internet, so I can share my experience and ideas with everyone including my friends. It's good feeling to receive any comments from others.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span><span style="text-decoration:underline;">2. Why blog in English?</span></p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>I have another blog in TianYa in Chinese which is also a past time. At the first time, I wrote some through and mood log in the blog. With the time goes by it become my goals maker in the internet, because I want to cheer me up with some goals. Then I found Google Calendar does a much greater bog in goal-setting and gradually I forget my TianYa blog.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>In English, the benefits is said in the previous answers, setting a English environment &nbsp;for me.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span><span style="text-decoration:underline;">3. What will be written in this blog?</span></p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>It should be my thinking about my research in projects and the curriculum. Using the new words and sentences I learnt.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Besides, my mood log will be another part in this blog.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>It is not necessary to repost any other articles to my blog. Also, something like planing is also not pleased because of the Google Calendar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Originally , there should be five questions. But when I finishing answering the third question, I found the rest two question has been answered the three answers.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>OK, it seem not a worry about the lack of words for this true article.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>It is good start.</p>
