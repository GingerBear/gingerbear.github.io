<p>It's the NOKIA 1616, One of the most Fundamental phone in the recent products.</p>
<p>Why do I thoose this one? but not some Android phone, or Symbian phone? Serveral factors I take into account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first one, which is the most fatal one, is the time I will spent on it. If I choose some Andorid phone(actually, I do have some target like samsung 5700, HTC wildfire...), I will not only take a lot of time on setuping lots of apps and refresh it to the latest OS version, but also spend timet to use these apps, then SNS, Weibo, renren.... However, if I those NOKIA 1616, there will be no such functions avalible. No SNS, no UCWeb, maybe QQ is also gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the last term,&nbsp;Let me make a evaluation.Suppose I spend&nbsp;15min on Sina Weibo,&nbsp;15min&nbsp;on QQ, 15min&nbsp;on renren, 15min&nbsp;on RSS. Total time is 1 hour. Considering the preparing time for GRE, there remains 60 day left. Then there wil be 60 hours wasted on cellphone, equivallently 5 days, almost a week. This time cost is unaffordable, so I do not choose Android or Symbian 60.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second factor is the cost. Compared with&nbsp;￥191 the price of NOKIA 1616, the cheapest Symbain60 phone is NOKIA 6120c, whose price is ￥800, nearly 4 times. Similarly, the prcies of Android phones are almost higher than ￥1000.</p>
<p>The third fator is power. It is said the the 1616 can be online for 6 weeks at best without charging. This sayings may be&nbsp;aggrandized, but for one week is a shock to me, because my service SAMSUNG i450 can will be out of power in half of a day with normal using. The power issue is the one of the deadly shortage of the Smart phone like Andorid and Symbian, which must be charge everyday.</p>
<p>The last reason is Updating of the Smart phone. If I spend one or two thousand yuan buying an android phone, it is definite thing that this phone is out of date. Now in the market, the newly relesed products are almost very expensive, ususly higher than ￥3000. Even though I bought the latest products with my bloodly money, newer tech is surging, higher CPU is manufacted, larger RAM is maked in half of a year. Especially in China, a unmatured smart phone envirnments, smart phone can not entirly do what thay can do. So why not save the money just wait for the real revolutionary moment, and revolutionary product.&nbsp;</p>
