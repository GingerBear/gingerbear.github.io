<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Two days have gone of the seven days holiday. It is fast because I planed a lot for this seven days. But till now, nearly nothing has been start really with heart.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Generally speaking, it is result from the stereotype sense of holiday which should be time to relax conflicting with my ambition to study in this special time. Ha ha , Like the first blog, it can be called dilemma again. I want to study now, but in this moment I have not been doing any studying for almost twenty years.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Maybe I should go out to relax for a while, then come back. I will get some fresher air of study.</p>
