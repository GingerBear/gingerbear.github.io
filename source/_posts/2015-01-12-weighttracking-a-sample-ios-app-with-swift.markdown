Trying to learn somthing new. Turns out that I am try to lose weight. Qi is a iOS developer. So why not bulid a sample iOS app that can tracking my weight. 

The requirement:
- a input field to enter weight and a optional datetime picker to chose time (default to current)
- a list that show all records that was entered.
- ablity to edit the data in case wrong input.
- diagram of change of weigth by time
- should be about to tell weigh's loss/gain by week/month
- auto-sync with remote storage

Screen:
- screen 1: input field of weight, and a button to toggle datatime picker. top right button to show changing diagram
- screen 2: changing diagram. top right button to show all record in list, click to edit
- screen 3: edit single record.

Development is on going. The github repo is https://github.com/Qiki/WeightTracking.

To bo continued.
