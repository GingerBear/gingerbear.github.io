<p>Last night in the reading class, I read a short passage, which tells that great comics are never otherwordly and it never mystify us. They seek to accentuate the contradicitions in the social actions, not gloss over or transcend them by appeals to extrasocial symbols of divine ends, cosmic purpose, or laws of nature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The characters of great comics is no other than the character in which form I want to express my bloggings. Every time the signal of writing occur to me, the first thing I think is something big, holy or cosmical. But in fact I myself have master such skills or thoughts. Perhaps such stereotype forms in the 7 years' high school writing experience. Every composition force me to write something that I never thought in my mind. So that the result of why I always hate writing worse than anything else, then gradually formed the writingphobia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the first expression of New Oriental course, I found it's like a warfare. Any minute when you are out of your mind may kick you off. Three reasons may explained. </p>
<p>First, the speed of the teacher is very high. Nearly our teacher speaking for the whole ninety minutes without a little rest. Also the thinking speed is especially high that I have take all my concentration on what he said. Even though, I t is still hard to entirely understand his speech.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, the atmosphere is high bloody pressured. I was sitting at the last third row. I can see the whole class. And I found it is the most&nbsp;conscientious class I have ever take. Everyone is listening seriously to the course. This kind of atmosphere let myself go serious too.</p>
<p>Third, It cost my parents 1580 RMB to take this class. I must to make it worth the price, with taking my efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another scene impressed me last night. At the middle rest of the class, when is dark outside, I want to take a look at the outside scenery. It is any kinds of little stalls, including barbecues, boiling foods, bootleg books, snacks, cloths. It is quite lively and chaotic. Actually I don't really like them. But it is the very scene that I didn't have seen for really a long time, maybe 10 years. I can feel that I am acquainted with it several years ago when also taking a night school of New Concept English in HuXin high school. It is in my first year in middle high school. When the class is over which is almost near nine, ChenZhao who learning together with me like to eat the same kind of snack like that in bazzar last night.</p>
<p>It is the same kind of feelings in the bazzar, but different after the bazzar.&nbsp;</p>
