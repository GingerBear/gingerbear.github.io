I used to have two and half months to prepare for my TOEFL,and it past the first month now.

I feel that I have make a good progress in this month,especially  my reading skill.

Also the tough job --words--had been finished,though it's not stable.Reviewing the words might be one of things that should be done next month.

Next,it's the listening that I do listened a lot English materials such as college lectures,BBC news,few novels,but it seemingly didn't make too much effects.I didn't feel I had made much progress in listening to English.So making some changes in ways of practice should be planed next.

In the writing field there is zero.though t says that it's the easiest part of the test,I have to develop it in the next weeks for 4 tests in the DELTA book.

Speaking,maybe the most difficult one for me,also be filled with nothing.I have to find a good way to practice ,but not just speak to myself when walking alone with some F words.

<strong> OK.that is the overlooking to all four parts.Here are some things i should do next. </strong>

In the first two weeks, finish the DELTA books include the 4 simulative test and review the words.

In addition,8 papers in related to Internet views should be finished in this two weeks.

Also,the courses should be condensed,which maintains <em>Economic</em> and<em> The Dynamics of Mass Communication .</em>

In the later two weeks,I should try my best to finish the BARRON Book in order to make time to finish the OG and the official simulative test in the last two weeks.

In the first week ,the New Orient IBT courses(finding the way to practice the writing and listening and speaking skill) will be necessary in next week's 4 tests.So next month I should turn on my most energetic mode to do<strong> Books courses + all IBT courses + all DELTA Practice + 4 Papers + half Words.</strong>

At least one Blog every week,so next week I should make a week summery too.
