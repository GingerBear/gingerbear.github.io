<p>Chaffy Dish or Huo Guo or Fire Boiler is a&nbsp;famous&nbsp;kind of dish. On the Chaffy Dish(maybe is the accurate name), We cool raw food in the boiling soup which always been separated into spicy and not spicy in the shape of <em>the Eight Diagrams</em>. When the raw food has been cooled, we can put it dip in sauces which usually teel oil with&nbsp;mashed garlic. Then we can taste it.</p>
<p>Yesterday with <em>AppleET</em> we went to a Chaffy Dish restaurant named <em>Chang Yi Kou Huo Guo</em>(I found this restaurant on dianping.com which is a website for evaluating restaurants or stores.&nbsp;). AppleET is a typical ChongQing girl who love the Chaffy Dish best, and she always confirm that ChongQing is the true birthland of&nbsp;Chaffy Dish, not SiChuan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is hard to describe how the dishes tasted, but in a word, it is vary delicious. AppleET even prise that it is the best Chaffy Dish in Wuhan she has ever taken. And more seriously we two spend 171 yuan totally for this dish, which is really high cost -_-. Any way, it is really great moment in the first thirty minutes of the dish. Especially for me, it has been more than a month to taste such such amazing food. What I taken is boring breakfast and boring dinner and nothing at night. More than sixty percent I have eaten is the same, which are nothing more than Hot Dry Noodles, Fried Egg Cake,&nbsp;soya-bean milk in breakfast and two Liang(a unit of weight) Rice, a kind of meat dish and a vegetable dish. At night comes a fruit dish, sometimes apple, sometimes pears, sometimes mixed. It is because I am going on a diet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Close the end of the dish, I found I eat to much and my stomach was aching. It is such an extremely pain period that I nearly want to throw up. If I eat at that moment, any food can be the&nbsp;blasting fuse of the throwing up. About thirty minutes past, I just feel better. But AppleET was enjoying as happily as before and laughing at me -_-.</p>
<p>After the dish, we rush back to school by taxi. Then I went to a big big sleep. Even now, I can still feel the fire in my stomach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all, in the third day of the long holiday, I nominally take a real relaxation for the further hard life.</p>
