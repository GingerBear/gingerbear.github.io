I am Neil, internet name as GingerBear or LoadingBear where GingerBear is taken. Guanxiong Ding(丁冠雄) is my Chinese name. 

I was born in Wuhan China in a high school teacher family. I move to Shanghai with my family when I was 9 in 1998. I spend 4 years on my undergraduate back to Wuhan in Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2012. After I recieved a degree of communication (mass communication), I went abroad to study Information Science in University of Pittsburgh in United State. Gradudated with a master degree, I am currently working in a Pittsburgh-based tech company named [Branding Brand](http://brandingbrand.com/). My job is, as a front-end developer, builing mobile e-commerce website for retailers. 

My current career focus is web technology, which means HTML, CSS and JavaScript. More specificly, handlebars as template engine, stylus as CSS preprocessor, jQuery as browser JavaScript library. I am using Node Express as the primary server side program. I am also exposed with Ember as part of the tech stack. I am currently in a "stable developer state" that I can fluently build middle-size web application but in a stuggle to be better. 

At this blog place, I write down my idea about technology that I learn, and meaningful things happened in my life.

This blog is bulid on Octopress and hosted on github page. I am using a 13 inch retina MacBook Pro late 2013. I use [Github](https://github.com/GingerBear) to mantian most of my work. Sublime text is my main editor.
